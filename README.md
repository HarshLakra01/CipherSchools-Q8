# Show Input Text Example

This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript to read user input from a text field and display it on the page when a button is clicked. The logic is separated into an external JavaScript file for clarity and maintainability.

## Features

- **Input field** for user text entry
- **Button** to trigger the display action
- **Output area** (`<span>`) that updates to show the entered text
- Uses modern JavaScript event handling for clean code structure

## Files

- `index.html`  
  The main HTML file containing the input, button, and output elements.
- `showInput.js`  
  The external JavaScript file that handles the button click event and updates the output.
